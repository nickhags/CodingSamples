# CodingSamples

This repository holds coding samples in various programming and scripting languages for my professional use. No Miami University course assignment code appears in this repository.

## Languages/versions represented:
- Python (version 2.7 and 3.8)
- Bash (version 5.0.18)
- C/C++ (-std=c++14, gcc 10.2.0)

## Notes
- Python 2 was required for the development for a few of the scripts, based on available runtime environments.
- These codes were all used in a controlled environment within a small research group. As such, they don't contain extensive argument checks, documentation, or error reporting. The design of these codes is purely functionality in an HPC setting.
